How to use this package: First begin a strippenkaart environment with \begin{strippenkaart}. An optional argument for the scale of the strippenkaart can be given, you can for example make the picture 2 times bigger by beginning with \begin{strippenkaart}[2].
Now add crossings with \kruising{1}{2} where the first argument is the amount of roads that should be kept on your left, and the second in the amount of roads that should be kept on your right. Finally, end the environment with \end{strippenkaart}.
