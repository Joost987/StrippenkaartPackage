How to use this package: First begin a strippenkaart environment with \begin{strippenkaart}. An optional argument for the scale of the strippenkaart can be given, you can for example make the picture 2 times bigger by beginning with \begin{strippenkaart}[2].
Now add crossings with \kruising{1}{2} where the first argument is the amount of roads that should be kept on your left, and the second in the amount of roads that should be kept on your right. \kruisingstippel{1}{2}{3}{4} can also be used to make crossings with dashed lines. The first two arguments are still the amount of roads that should be kept to your left and right, the next two are how many of those lines you want to be dashed, again first for the left and then for the right. Finally, end the environment with \end{strippenkaart}.
